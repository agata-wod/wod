The guardspawner stores all information about the guards and their
routes in the :guardspawner:guardspawn datafile.  It checks what
guards need to be respawned by checking the serial numbers in the
global property "global_guard_list", which is a dictionary.  The
keys of the dictionary are the names of the datafile elements, and
the values is the serial number of that guard.

Each datafile element should look something like:

df (name)
{
	npctemplate	(template)
	spawnloc		(array, {x, y, z})
	route		(dictionary, see below)
}

The route is a dictionary used in the guard AI.  The keys of the dictionary
are integers that define the path the guard should take (1, 2, 3, etc).  The
values of the dictionary are an array.  Each array has at least 1 value.  The
possible values of that first value are:

"go" - this is the next location to go to.  In this case, the array has 3 more elements
	that define the x, y, z location of the next stop point
"wait" - stop and look around.
"door" - try to open doors at this location, then move on
